Examples of analog human computting are infinite. Hutchins navigation, etc... Does it become CS when we start to reason and optimize and design these processes? Also, all is external, like Hutchins model. Does this externalized social model extend to pen and paper calculation, abacuses, as Hutchins suggests?\
